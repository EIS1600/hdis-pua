# Preface{-}

This is a Handbook for Digital Islamicate Studies. Work in progress, based on courses tought. The current instantiation is a hands-on course that provides a practical introduction to the R programming language for historians with a specific focus on analyzing prosopographical data. The primary dataset that we will explore comes from the “Prosopografía de ulemas de al-Andalus” (PUA) project (https://www.eea.csic.es/pua/), which contains information on Muslim scholars from al-Andalus. The course is designed for those with no prior programming experience but assumes some familiarity with Arabic and Spanish, as the PUA data is primarily in these languages. The language of instruction will be English.
