### Finding your way around the computer

#### Explanation of file system and directories

A **file system** is a method used by an operating system (OS) to organize, store, and manage files and directories (also known as folders) on a storage device, such as a hard drive, SSD, or USB flash drive. The file system controls how data is stored, accessed, and retrieved, enabling users to create, modify, and delete files and directories.

**Directories** (or folders) are containers used to organize files hierarchically, making it easier to manage and navigate files within the file system. A directory can contain other directories, creating a tree-like structure that starts from a root directory.

Here is an explanation of file systems and directories using a simple example:

1.  Root directory: This is the top-level directory in a file system hierarchy. On Windows, the root directory is usually represented as `C:` (or another letter for additional drives), while on macOS and Linux systems, it is represented as `/`.

Example:

-   Windows: `C:\`
-   macOS or Linux: `/`

2.  Subdirectories: Subdirectories (or subfolders) are directories that are contained within other directories. They can be nested within each other to create a hierarchical structure that groups related files together.

Example:

-   Projects (a top-level directory)
    -   History_Project (a subdirectory within the Projects directory)
        -   Research (a subdirectory within the History_Project directory)
        -   Drafts (another subdirectory within the History_Project directory)

3.  File paths: A file path is a representation of the location of a file or directory within the file system hierarchy. It shows the sequence of directories that must be navigated to reach a specific file or folder.

Example:

-   Windows: `C:\Projects\History_Project\Research\primary_source.pdf`
-   macOS or Linux: `/Projects/History_Project/Research/primary_source.pdf`

4.  File extensions: File extensions are short suffixes (usually three or four characters) added to the end of a file name, preceded by a period. They indicate the file type and determine which programs can open and edit the file.

Example:

-   Document: `report.docx` (Microsoft Word document)
-   Image: `photo.jpeg` (JPEG image)
-   Spreadsheet: `budget.xlsx` (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet)

Understanding file systems and directories is essential for organizing, managing, and navigating files on a computer. By creating a well-structured directory hierarchy and using clear naming conventions for files and folders, users can easily locate and access the information they need.

If you need to share a file with someone who has a different operating system or software, consider using a widely supported file format or exporting the file in a format that can be opened by their software.

Both Mac and Windows may hide file extensions and you may want to change settings of your file manager (Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on MacOS) to show this information. How exactly this should be done may differ from one version of the same operating system to another. It is always best to “google” information relevant to your OS.

### Organizing files and folders for research projects

Organizing files and folders for research projects is crucial for efficient project management and easy access to relevant information. A well-organized structure helps you keep track of your work, collaborate with others, and prevent loss of data. Here are some tips for organizing files and folders for research projects:

1.  Create a main project folder: Start by creating a main folder for the entire research project. Name it clearly and descriptively, so you can easily identify it among other folders.

2.  Establish a consistent folder structure: Within the main project folder, create subfolders for different components of the research project, such as data, literature, drafts, and presentations. It's essential to establish a consistent folder structure that is easy to understand and navigate.

Example of a folder structure:

```
PROJECT/
    ├── Data/
    │   ├── Raw_Data/
    │   └── Processed_Data/
    ├── Literature/
    │   ├── Articles/
    │   └── Books/
    ├── Classes/
    │   ├── Class_01/
    │   ├── Class_02/
    │   └── Class_03/
    ├── Presentations/
    └── Meeting_Notes/
```

3.  Use clear and descriptive file and folder names: When naming files and folders, use clear, descriptive, and concise names that provide context and indicate the content. Avoid using vague or generic names, and try to include relevant information like dates, version numbers, or authors.

Example of clear file names:

-   `2021-05-01_Interview_Transcript_JaneDoe.docx`
-   `Literature_Review_v3.pdf`

4.  Use version control: When working on drafts or revising documents, use version numbers or dates in file names to keep track of different iterations. This practice helps you maintain a clear history of changes and makes it easier to locate previous versions if needed.

Example of version control in file names:

-   `Research_Paper_v1.docx`
-   `Research_Paper_v2.docx`
-   `Research_Paper_v3_Final.docx`

5.  Keep raw and processed data separate: When working with data, create separate folders for raw data (unaltered, original files) and processed data (cleaned or transformed data). This practice helps prevent accidental changes to the original data and makes it easier to track the data processing steps.

6.  Regularly backup your data: To prevent data loss, regularly backup your project files and folders to an external storage device or a cloud storage service. Schedule routine backups and ensure that all team members are aware of the backup process.

7.  Document your organization system: Create a readme file or a project documentation file that explains the organization system, including the folder structure, file naming conventions, and any other relevant information. This documentation helps maintain consistency and makes it easier for team members or future researchers to understand and navigate the project files.

### Tips for efficient command line usage

Here is a list of tips for efficient command line usage that can help you improve your productivity and make your command line experience more enjoyable:

1.  **Learn keyboard shortcuts:** Familiarize yourself with keyboard shortcuts for common tasks, such as copying, pasting, and moving between words or lines. For example, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V for copying and pasting, respectively, or Ctrl+Left/Right to move between words.
    
2.  **Use command history:** Both Windows Command Prompt and Mac Terminal keep a history of commands you have previously executed. Use the Up and Down arrow keys to navigate through your command history and avoid retyping the same commands repeatedly.
    
3.  **Auto-completion:** Use the Tab key to auto-complete file and folder names, command names, or command options. Pressing Tab once will complete the name if it is unique or show the available options if multiple choices exist. Pressing Tab twice will display all the matching options.
    
4.  **Pipelining and redirection:** Learn how to use pipes (`|`) and redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`) to combine commands and manipulate input/output. For example, you can pipe the output of one command as input to another command or redirect the output of a command to a file.
    
5.  **Batch scripting or shell scripting:** Automate repetitive tasks by creating batch scripts (Windows) or shell scripts (Mac/Linux). These scripts can execute multiple commands in sequence or even include control structures like loops and conditionals.
    
6.  **Aliases and custom functions:** Create aliases or custom functions for frequently used commands or command sequences. This can help you save time and avoid typing long commands repeatedly.
    
7.  **Learn grep, awk, and sed:** Familiarize yourself with text processing utilities like `grep`, `awk`, and `sed` to filter, transform, and manipulate text data efficiently.
    
8.  **Version control systems:** Learn to use version control systems like Git to manage your code and projects. It helps you keep track of changes and collaborate with others effectively.
    
9.  **Explore command-line tools:** Discover and experiment with command-line tools and utilities available for your operating system. Many tools can help you accomplish tasks more efficiently than using graphical applications.
    
10.  **Customize your environment:** Customize your command line environment by tweaking settings, appearance, and behavior to suit your preferences. This can make your command line experience more enjoyable and personalized.
    

By incorporating these tips into your command line usage, you can become more efficient and productive while navigating and managing tasks using the command line interface.
